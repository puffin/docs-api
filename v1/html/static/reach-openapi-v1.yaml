      The Reach Web API allows components and clients to interact with the reach ecosystem.
  - name: basics
    description: |
      All methods must be called using HTTPS. Arguments can be passed as GET or POST params, or a mix.
      The response contains a JSON object, which will always contain a top-level boolean property
      `ok`, indicating success or failure. For failure results, the `error` property will contain a
      short machine-readable error code.

      ```json
      {
        "ok": true,
        "stuff": "This is good"
      }
      ```
      ```json
      {
        "ok": false,
        "error": "something_bad"
      }
      ```
  - name: authentication
    description: |
      The majority of the Reach API require authentication as a user.

      Make an HTTP POST to `api.rea.ch/v1/auth/login` with a JSON body indicating the
      user’s `email` and `password`.

      ```
      curl -i -d '{"email":"someone@nowhere.com","password":"thisisabadpassword"}' https://api.rea.ch/v1/auth/login
      ```

      If successful, the response will contain a `JWT Access token` and a `JWT Refresh token`.

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2015 13:21:14 GMT
      Content-Length: 657
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

      {
        "ok": true,
        "tokens": {
          "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzaWQiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIn0.jfk27TWEdnHx6kCZwzvX5ZhdAf9uDFmQHZopoh2h4kU",
          "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzaWQiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0.dJltAPWAQ36LQsS2ottsKpZ4Pxadykvg04Ys-34bDbo"
        }
      }
      ```

      Include the `JWT Access token` as part of the `Authorization` header on your future API requests with the `Bearer` method.

      ```
      curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...' https://api.rea.ch/v1/account/user/me
      ```

      You should now be able to access the API as the user you logged in as.

      Additional information on JWT Tokens can be found here: https://jwt.io/introduction/

  - name: websocket
    description: |
      In addition to the HTTP RESTful API, Reach also offers a Real-Time API
      based on WebSocket that allows our clients (mobile and web based) to send messages
      and receives events from reach backend in real-time.

      To connect to the WebSocket, clients follow the standard opening handshake as [defined by the RFC specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.3) to the `websocket.rea.ch` endpoint of Reach.

      #### Authentication

      The client authenticated itself with the WebSocket using the same JWT Token as it would use in RESTful requests.

      To authenticate, the client pass the JWT token in the WebSocket URI when connecting.

      Once successfully authenticated, the server will pass a `hello` WebSocket event over the connection.

      ```json
      {
        "type": "hello"
      }
      ```

      #### Events

      WebSocket events are primarily used to alert the client to changes in reach, such as delivering new messages, passing new inbox events or alerting the client that another user is typing in a conversation.

      Events on the WebSocket will have the form:

      ```json
      {
        "type": "message",
        "data": {
          "sid": "1355517523.000005",
          "date_created": "2017-06-21T13:03:32Z",
          "from": "U228389023",
          "to": "C9375920278",
          "body": "Hello World!"
        }
      }
      ```

      #### WebSocket API

      Clients can send a message to reach by sending JSON over the websocket connection.

      Every message sent should have a unique positive integer ID. All replies to that message
      will include this ID allowing the client to correlate responses with the messages sent;
      replies may be "out of order" due to the asynchronous nature of the message servers.

      Also, as with events sent from the server, each event sent by the client has a string
      type specifying what the message does. Chat messages are of type message.

      So to post a message:

      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "message",
        "data": {
          "to": "C9375920278",
          "body": "John, John, I am a message!"
        }
      }
      ```

      Once the JSON has been sent to the server, clients should immediately display the text in the conversation,
      knowing it is pending. At some point after that the server will send a confirmation that the message was received:

      ```json
      {
        "ok": true,
        "reply_to": 1,
        "type": "message",
        "data": {
          "sid": "1482960137.003543",
          "date_created": "2017-06-21T13:03:32Z",
          "from": "U228389023",
          "to": "C9375920278",
          "body": "John, John, I am a message!"
        }
      }
      ```

      In the case of an error, the response would be:

      ```json
      {
        "ok": false,
        "reply_to": 1,
        "error": "no_text"
      }
      ```

  - name: 4. bindings
    description: |
      The Binding resource binds a User to its Address. Addresses are different per channel.
      For instance, for iOS push notifications the address is an APNS device token.
      Creating a Binding for an Identity and Address allows to send notifications to an
      identity rather than a specific device.

  - name: 5. authentication
    description: |
      In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials,
      a JSON Web Token will be returned and must be saved locally, instead of the
      traditional approach of creating a session in the server and returning a cookie.

      Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent
      should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema.
      The content of the header should look like the following.

      ```
      Authorization: Bearer [token]
      ```

      This is a stateless authentication mechanism as the user state is never saved
      in server memory. The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in
      the Authorization header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access
      protected resources. As JWTs are self-contained, all the necessary information
      is there, reducing the need to query the database multiple times.
